//A C++ priority queue is a type of container adapter, specifically designed such that 
//the first element of the queue is either the greatest or the smallest of all elements 
//in the queue, and elements are in non-increasing or non-decreasing order 
//(hence we can see that each element of the queue has a priority {fixed order}).

//In C++ STL, the top element is always the greatest by default. We can also change it 
//to the smallest element at the top. Priority queues are built on the top of the max 
//heap and use an array or vector as an internal structure. In simple terms, 
//STL Priority Queue is the implementation of Heap Data Structure.

// 3 functions in priority_queue:
// pq.push(); works in O(log N)
// pq.pop();  works in O( log N )
// pq.top();  works in O(1)


// C++ program to demonstrate the use of priority_queue
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

// driver code
int main()
{
    int arr[6] = { 10, 2, 4, 8, 6, 9 };

    // defining priority queue
    priority_queue<int> pq;

    // printing array
    cout << "Array: ";
    for (auto i : arr) {
        cout << i << ' ';
    }
    cout << endl;
    // pushing array sequentially one by one
    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        pq.push(arr[i]);
    }

    // printing priority queue
    cout << "Priority Queue: ";
    while (!pq.empty()) {
        cout << pq.top() << ' ';
        pq.pop();
    }

    return 0;
