REACT LEARNING
1) VITE : Vite is an npm package that helps you run and build frontend applications fast.
When you install or use Vite, it:
Starts your frontend app, Shows it in the browser, Reloads changes instantly, Prepares the app for production. It is not a framework, just a tool.

Why is Vite useful in frontend?
Without Vite: Browser doesn’t understand JSX / TypeScript, You’d have to manually refresh pages, No optimization for production.
With Vite: JSX, TS, modern JS → works automatically, Instant reload when you save a file, Fast startup, Easy production build. It makes frontend development easy and fast.

Why is it called a development server?
Because during development, Vite runs a local server like: http://localhost:5173
This server: Serves your frontend files, Updates the browser when code changes, Exists only while developing, It is not the real production server.

What does this “server” actually do?
In simple words, the Vite dev server: Converts your code (JSX, TS) → browser-readable JS, Sends files to browser when requested, Reloads only the changed part (HMR).
It creates an environment where browsers can understand your modern frontend code.

2) react-router-dom : It is a npm package. React apps are single-page applications (SPA), so:
The page does not reload, But the URL still needs to change, Different components should show for different URLs.
react-router-dom makes this possible.
react-router-dom enables client-side routing in React apps, allowing navigation between components(like /login -> login component, / -> home component etc.) without page reloads.

3) lucide-react : It is a npm package using which we can put icons in react app.

4) react-hot-toast : It is a npm package using which we can have notifications in react app.

5) react-player : It is a npm package using which we can play videos in react app.

6) Installing Tailwindcss + vite : if you write this on browser it will take you to a site. we need to install some npm packages to use tailwindcss in vite, we can see about them in from https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite.

7) Clerk : Clerk is an authentication and user management service for web apps.

What does Clerk provide : Login / Signup UI, Email & password auth, OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.), Session management, User profiles, Secure tokens. All ready-made.
Clerk ko backend mein bhi package install karna hota hai uska as user ka sara data clerk ke pass hoga as login clerk hi karwaya tha.

8) Prebuilt ui : this site has many prebuilt ui, like footer, navbar etc and you get the code also.
