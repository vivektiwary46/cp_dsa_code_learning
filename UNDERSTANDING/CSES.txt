1) Any problem where entities are connected and you need to explore reachability between them can usually be represented as a graph. Each cell in the grid becomes node, and each valid move to an adjacent cell is an edge. This is called implicit graph construction - we don't store an adjacency list, we use the grid itself to traverse : This can be also seen in grid graph problems.
2) see graph11.cpp for all the cycle detection in different graphs.
